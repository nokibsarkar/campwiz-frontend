# CampWiz Frontend Server
This is CampWiz Frontend Server. It is responsible for the frontend of the CampWiz application. It is built using Next.js and TypeScript as well as TailWindcss and MaterialUI for styling. It is a monorepo that contains the frontend server and the shared components library.
## Getting Started
First, run the development server:
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables. You can use `.env.example` as a reference.
- Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install` or `bun install`
- Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### 03-03-2025 Reduction in production size
**Hash**: [cd24d41d5140f4e16217bab13e476d16f2a0bdf1](https://github.com/nokibsarkar/campwiz-frontend/commit/330abc453bf0725228b4fe6fb0c3c93785a0ef67)

Reduction in production size from 2.5 GB (approximately) to 137 MB (approximately) using `standalone` build. 

### 14-05-2025 11:41 PM BST: Deployed to Toolforge
**Hash**: [2eeecaca4476e4994f5ce597a0637e5b8c721c0c](https://github.com/nokibsarkar/campwiz-frontend/commit/2eeecaca4476e4994f5ce597a0637e5b8c721c0c)

After A lot of effort, I was able to deploy the frontend server to Toolforge ([campwiz.toolforge.org](https://campwiz.toolforge.org)). The deployment process was quite challenging, but I learned a lot along the way. I had to make several changes to the codebase to make it compatible with Toolforge's environment. Thank You very much @dhinus for your support. 

My development was using nodejs version 22 but the toolforge environment was using nodejs version 18. Anyway, I built the project using github actions on nodejs version 22 and then uploaded the build using rsync + ssh to `~/www/js/` as `standalone` build. On that folder, I created `.env` file and added the environment variables. The nextjs frontend server is still running on nodejs 18, though the code was built on nodejs 22. I am not sure if it will work or not. Let's hope for the best.
